# Tarspot-histology-microbiome-investigation
Investigating tarspot microbiome via DIAMOND and MEGAN to attempt identification of two unknown fungi found within tarspot stroma

Part of the "Uncovering the Infection Strategy of Phyllachora maydis during Maize Colonization: A Comprehensive Analysis" manuscruipt (Caldwell et al 202X)

Illumina reads were first trimmed to Q20 before filtering out corn and Phyllachora maydis sequences. Remaining reads were mapped to the NCBI-nr database and identified via DIAMOND and MEGAN programs at the Michigan State University HPCC.

Raw reads can be found in the Sequence Read Archives under bioproject XXXXXXXX

Data here are the exported identity counts of reads mapped and identified from MEGAN for visualization in R
